Sonic Lambda
============

**Status:** WIP, currently the implementation has numerous known flaws. Consider it the same quality as a piece of scratch paper with some scribbles on. 


What is it?
-----------

Sonic lambda is a fast and memory efficient implementation of the lambda-calculus.

It uses the following techniques:

 * The internal term representation uses [De Bruijn indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index)

 * Expressions are allocated in an arena/region
 
 * TODO ...
 

Sonic -- really?
----------------

[Sonic the hedgehog](https://www.sonicthehedgehog.com/) is *fast* and
wastes *little memory* remembering the awful things we put him
through. It's a perfect match.

Alas, too many other projects are already using Sonic, thus we'll
eventually need to find another name.
